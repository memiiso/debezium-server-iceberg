# Debezium Iceberg Consumers

Replicates database CDC events to Iceberg(Cloud storage, hdfs) without using Spark, Kafka or Streaming platform.

## `iceberg` Consumer

Iceberg consumer replicates debezium CDC events to destination Iceberg tables. It is possible to replicate source database one to one or run it with append mode and keep all change events in iceberg table. When event and key schema
enabled (`debezium.format.value.schemas.enable=true`, `debezium.format.key.schemas.enable=true`) destination Iceberg
tables created automatically with initial job.

### Upsert

By default, Iceberg consumer is running with upsert mode `debezium.sink.iceberg.upsert=true`. 
Upsert mode uses source Primary Key and does upsert on target table(delete followed by insert). For the tables without Primary Key consumer falls back to append mode.

#### Data Deduplication

With upsert mode per batch data deduplication is done. Deduplication is done based on `__source_ts_ms` value and event type `__op`.
its is possible to change field using `debezium.sink.iceberg.upsert-dedup-column=__source_ts_ms`. Currently only
Long field type supported.

Operation type priorities are `{"c":1, "r":2, "u":3, "d":4}`. When two records with same key and same `__source_ts_ms`
values received then the record with higher `__op` priority is kept and added to destination table and duplicate record is dropped.

### Append
Setting `debezium.sink.iceberg.upsert=false` will set the operation mode to append. With append mode data deduplication is not done and all received records are appended to destination table.
Note: For the tables without primary key operation mode falls back to append even configuration is set to upsert mode

#### Keeping Deleted Records

By default `debezium.sink.iceberg.upsert-keep-deletes=true` keeps deletes in the Iceberg table, setting it to false
will remove deleted records from the destination Iceberg table. With this config it's possible to keep last version of a
record in the destination Iceberg table(doing soft delete).

### Optimizing batch size (or commit interval)

Debezium extracts database events in real time and this could cause too frequent commits or too many small files
which is not optimal for batch processing especially when near realtime data feed is sufficient. 
To avoid this problem following batch-size-wait classes are used. 

Batch size wait adds delay between consumer calls to increase total number of events received per call and meanwhile events are collected in memory.
This setting should be configured together with `debezium.source.max.queue.size` and `debezium.source.max.batch.size` debezium properties


#### NoBatchSizeWait

This is default configuration by default consumer will not use any wait. All the events are consumed immediately.

#### DynamicBatchSizeWait
**Deprecated** 
This wait strategy dynamically adds wait to increase batch size. Wait duration is calculated based on number of processed events in
last 3 batches. if last batch sizes are lower than `max.batch.size` Wait duration will increase and if last batch sizes
are bigger than 90% of `max.batch.size` Wait duration will decrease

This strategy optimizes batch size between 85%-90% of the `max.batch.size`, it does not guarantee consistent batch size.

example setup to receive ~2048 events per commit. maximum wait is set to 5 seconds
```properties
debezium.source.max.queue.size=16000
debezium.source.max.batch.size=2048
debezium.sink.batch.batch-size-wait=DynamicBatchSizeWait
debezium.sink.batch.batch-size-wait.max-wait-ms=5000
```
#### MaxBatchSizeWait

MaxBatchSizeWait uses debezium metrics to optimize batch size, this strategy is more precise compared to DynamicBatchSizeWait.
MaxBatchSizeWait periodically reads streaming queue current size and waits until it reaches to `max.batch.size`. 
Maximum wait and check intervals are controlled by `debezium.sink.batch.batch-size-wait.max-wait-ms`, `debezium.sink.batch.batch-size-wait.wait-interval-ms` properties.

example setup to receive ~2048 events per commit. maximum wait is set to 30 seconds, streaming queue current size checked every 5 seconds
```properties
debezium.sink.batch.batch-size-wait=MaxBatchSizeWait
debezium.sink.batch.metrics.snapshot-mbean=debezium.postgres:type=connector-metrics,context=snapshot,server=testc
debezium.sink.batch.metrics.streaming-mbean=debezium.postgres:type=connector-metrics,context=streaming,server=testc
debezium.source.connector.class=io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector
debezium.source.max.batch.size=2048");
debezium.source.max.queue.size=16000");
debezium.sink.batch.batch-size-wait.max-wait-ms=30000
debezium.sink.batch.batch-size-wait.wait-interval-ms=5000
```

### Table Name Mapping

Iceberg tables are named by following rule : `table-namespace`.`table-prefix``database.server.name`_`database`_`table`

For example:

```properties
debezium.sink.iceberg.table-namespace=default
database.server.name=testc
debezium.sink.iceberg.table-prefix=cdc_
```

With above config database table = `inventory.customers` is replicated to `default.testc_cdc_inventory_customers`

## Debezium Event Flattening

Iceberg consumer requires event flattening.
```properties
debezium.transforms=unwrap
debezium.transforms.unwrap.type=io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState
debezium.transforms.unwrap.add.fields=op,table,source.ts_ms,db
debezium.transforms.unwrap.add.headers=db
debezium.transforms.unwrap.delete.handling.mode=rewrite
```

### Configuring iceberg 

All the properties starting with `debezium.sink.iceberg.__ICEBERG_CONFIG__` are passed to Iceberg, and to hadoopConf

```properties
debezium.sink.iceberg.{iceberg.prop.name}=xyz-value # passed to iceberg!
```

### Example Configuration

```properties
debezium.sink.type=iceberg
# run with append mode
debezium.sink.iceberg.upsert=false
debezium.sink.iceberg.upsert-keep-deletes=true
# iceberg
debezium.sink.iceberg.table-prefix=debeziumcdc_
debezium.sink.iceberg.table-namespace=debeziumevents
debezium.sink.iceberg.fs.defaultFS=s3a://S3_BUCKET);
debezium.sink.iceberg.warehouse=s3a://S3_BUCKET/iceberg_warehouse
debezium.sink.iceberg.type=hadoop
debezium.sink.iceberg.catalog-name=mycatalog
debezium.sink.iceberg.catalog-impl=org.apache.iceberg.hadoop.HadoopCatalog
# enable event schemas
debezium.format.value.schemas.enable=true
debezium.format.value=json
# complex nested data types are not supported, do event flattening. unwrap message!
debezium.transforms=unwrap
debezium.transforms.unwrap.type=io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState
debezium.transforms.unwrap.add.fields=op,table,source.ts_ms,db
debezium.transforms.unwrap.delete.handling.mode=rewrite
debezium.transforms.unwrap.drop.tombstones=true
```

## Schema Change Behaviour

It is possible to get out of sync schemas between source and target tables. Foexample when the source database change its schema, adds or drops field. Here we documented possible schema changes and current behavior of the Iceberg consumer.

#### Adding new column to source (A column missing in destination iceberg table)
Data of the new column is ignored till same column added to destination iceberg table

Dor example: if a column not found in iceberg table its data is dropped ignored and not copied to target!
once iceberg table adds same column then data for this column recognized and populated

#### Removing column from source (An extra column in iceberg table)
These columns are populated with null value

#### Renaming column in source
This is combination of above two cases : old column will be populated with null values and new column will not be recognized and populated till it's added to iceberg table

#### Different Data Types
This is the scenario when source field type and Target Iceberg field type are different. In this case consumer converts source field value to destination type value. Conversion is done by jackson If representation cannot be converted to destination type then default value is returned!

for example this is conversion rule to Long type: 
```Method that will try to convert value of this node to a Java long. Numbers are coerced using default Java rules; booleans convert to 0 (false) and 1 (true), and Strings are parsed using default Java language integer parsing rules.
If representation cannot be converted to a long (including structured types like Objects and Arrays), default value of 0 will be returned; no exceptions are thrown.
```

## `icebergevents` Consumer

This is second consumer in this project. This consumer appends CDC events to single Iceberg table as json string. 
This table partitioned by `event_destination,event_sink_timestamptz` and sorted by `event_sink_epoch_ms`

#### Example Configuration

````properties
debezium.sink.type=icebergevents
debezium.sink.iceberg.catalog-name=default
````

Iceberg table definition:

```java
static final String TABLE_NAME="debezium_events";
static final Schema TABLE_SCHEMA = new Schema(
    required(1, "event_destination", Types.StringType.get()),
    optional(2, "event_key", Types.StringType.get()),
    optional(3, "event_value", Types.StringType.get()),
    optional(4, "event_sink_epoch_ms", Types.LongType.get()),
    optional(5, "event_sink_timestamptz", Types.TimestampType.withZone())
    );
static final PartitionSpec TABLE_PARTITION = PartitionSpec.builderFor(TABLE_SCHEMA)
    .identity("event_destination")
    .hour("event_sink_timestamptz")
    .build();
static final SortOrder TABLE_SORT_ORDER = SortOrder.builderFor(TABLE_SCHEMA)
    .asc("event_sink_epoch_ms", NullOrder.NULLS_LAST)
    .build();
```
